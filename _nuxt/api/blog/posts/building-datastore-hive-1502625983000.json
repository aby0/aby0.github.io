    "description": "Coccinelle is a program matching tool which allows programmers to easily write some complex style-preserving source-to-source transformations on C source code, for instance, code refactoring.\nThere are useful online resources which document this tool very well, however it is slightly difficult for a beginner to understand these concepts through these materials. So this is my attempt to explain the details of this tool in more convenient way.",
